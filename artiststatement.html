            <p><b>Joseph Anthony Toro</b><br><br>
            	Throughout my life I have worked in a wide variety of mediums. These mediums include clay sculpture, paper mache, drawing with charcoal, metal working and digital media as well. Art has always come to me as something very soothing I can do and focus on. I have a very hard time focusing in general and working on art allows me to feel normal and gives my life meaning. If I am not working on an art piece, I feel numb and useless. This drives me to constantly be working on my skills as an artists. My interests include anything that I can observe and create such as video games and skateboarding. I feel that skateboarding is an amazing and beautiful way to express oneâ€™s self and I strive to capture the essence of any trick I can film. This also goes with my intentions in drawing and sculpture where I try to embody meaning through inanimate objects. Video art has so far been my favorite medium to work with.
	Video art interest me because there is so much that goes into it that may not be noticed the first time. Every time I watch a video again I pick up something I did not see the first time. This drives me to constantly put more and more effort into my creative process so that I can create content I am contempt with. I am very critical of my own work and I admire others who can produce the highest quality art within their own realm. I love The amount of thought and effort put into video making and I believe there is always room for improvement and the ability to learn more. I am a novice to film as a medium and I would love to learn as much as I can. Video making has been very stressful for me but it has opened the door to a whole new world I wish to discover.
